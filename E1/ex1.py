# we want to get from user two numbers and print the multiplication of them
# we will use the input function to get the numbers from the user
# we will use the print function to print the result

a = input("Enter the first number: ")
b = input("Enter the second number: ")

print("The multiplication of the two numbers is: ", a*b)

# you should fix the code to working as we expect to print multiplication of the two numbers
